# hello-world

Hi GitHub

I'm just stumbling around blindly at the moment since I have no idea what i'm doing. I like processing and Javascript and i'm a visual designer trying her hand at code. I just came here to have a good time, basically and i'm felling so attacked right now.

I find it very weird that this editor is wrapping the text I wrote on line six, though I can see that being pretty useful.

NEVERMIND I found the wrap text button. 

Cool, i'm liking this so far!
